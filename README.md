## Overview

This is a individual project for UBC course [*STAT 545A*](https://stat545.stat.ubc.ca/syllabus-545a/). The central objective is to perform exploratory data analysis using R and GitHub workflow. The focus is to perform the analysis using best practices for clean code writing, reproducibility, and thinking clarity in order to impact and engage the reader productively. The progress is as of 05<sup>th</sup> October 2023:

-   [x] Mini data analysis 1
    -   Glancing different data sets and choosing one through iteratively exploration.
    -   Choosing a data set and getting familiarized.
    -   Understand about data characteristics, trends and insights.
    -   Formulating 4 research questions based on preliminary results and understanding.
    -   Generate reproducible and clean analysis report
-   [ ] Mini data analysis 2

## Project Files

1.  **Milestone1**: Report rendered in Github friendly format.
2.  [*Milestone1.Rmd*](/Milestone1.rmd): Corresponding file containing the `R` code for the

## Code execution

The corrected code can be run from files [*Milestone1*](/Milestone1.Rmd) using `R` software along with additional packages such as `tidyverse`, `devtools`, and specifically `datateacher`. Using an IDE such as `RStudio` carries out this task easily.
